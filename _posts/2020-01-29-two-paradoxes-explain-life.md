My thoughts gush and rush like a waterfall
It is a stream of never ending faults and falls
To think of me not thinking is like falling from the fall
So I think just to prevent a fall that might be my last


Whether blank or full of life my thoughts become my life
As dull as they come I think them and they become my wife
Clinging to them or dismantling them becomes my duty
For if I deal with them with dote they become my deity


Now of things benign and beautiful I have devoted less time
Not because of naivet√©, but the fleeting nature of time and its dissonant chime
"Tempus fugit memento mori" the Master says
So there I lay thinking of Montaigne and his essays


In the stream of Montaigne's thoughts I find myself
For somewhere in there the Master says "Man know thyself"
If I think me worthy today, then my worth shall grow overtime
And I shall become firmly planted as engraved words without fear of falls and time.
