          <p>Born and raised in Nigeria &mdash; born in the South and raised in the Central-North. In the span of over two decades, I have learnt valuable lessons from my interactions with people from around the world. And in all of that murkiness of figuring out life, I have found that nothing beats a good sleep after a day's work. </p>
          <p>After I was born, life happened bla bla bla, I graduated from UC Berkeley after 4 years, served my country for a year, and now looking to achieve my childhood dreams of working around the clock while creating memorable moments that I will share with my kids.</p>
          <p>I am not an overthinker, but sometimes I try to find meaning in things that seem stupid just the way I am trying to find meaning in my life right now. At the moment, I am probably thinking of my next blog post, working or sleeping.  
          </p>
          <p>The greatest advice I have ever gotten is to wear my mind like a garment and wash it whenever it was dirty &mdash; I gave myself this advice. </p>
          <p>To answer the big question above &mdash; there is a lot to know about people, but there isn't much to know about me, although I like to believe I know a lot about myself.</p>

          <p>The world is indeed chaotic and full of problems as well as beautiful things and people all encompassed in nature so unimaginably designed. </p>
          <p>Our duty however, is to become resolute in our trajectory to make the world a better place one step at a time through smiles and actions as the years go by &mdash; that is my aim in life and I hope it is yours too. 
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, here lies both the freedoms and excesses of this world, and here is your heart. Feel it, touch it, own it, and don't let it fail.</p>
          <p class="mb-5">I fear each day for what might be, but I am extremely excited for the things that I will wrath. <br> <em>So walk with me.</em></p>
